 Description: 
           Q/SSIM averaged over all the spectral bands.
 
 Interface:
           Q_avg = Q(I1,I2,L)

 Inputs:
           I1:         First multispectral image;
           I2:         Second multispectral image;
           L:          Radiometric resolution.

 Outputs:
           Q_avg:      Q index averaged on all bands.
 
 Notes:
     Results very close to the MATLAB toolbox's ones. In particular, when S is odd the results are identical.
     Instead, when S is even ssim cannot work and S is modified to the closest odd number. In this way, the results are very very similar
     with respect to the MATLAB toolbox's ones when S is even.
